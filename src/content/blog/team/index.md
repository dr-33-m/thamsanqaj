# Together Everyone Achieves More

## Where It All Began

I come from nothing. Everything I have, where I am today; I've worked incredibly hard for it. My driving force has always been simple: to retire my mother and give her everything her heart desires. This singular motivation led me into a world that feels almost too good to be real.

That world is open-source.

## The Philosophy That Changed Everything

Open-source is the greatest thing I've ever encountered. I owe everything I am today to it, and to my family. The concept is mind-blowing in its purity, it cares and provides unconditionally, asking for nothing in return but the deep satisfaction of contribution.

Think about it: the idea that one can build for everyone, for free. Teach for free. Tear down the curtain behind the magic powering the world's infrastructure, motivated not by material gain but by genuine fulfillment. This philosophy stands as perhaps the only force preventing our world from being consumed entirely by corporate mercenaries.

## My Open-Source Education

I learned everything I know from open-source projects. I became a web developer because languages like JavaScript, Python, and C are open-source. Without them, I wouldn't be where I am today.

We didn't have the resources for university at home, and frankly, even if we had, I probably wouldn't have gone. My situation needed solutions immediately; I couldn't wait. I'm an autodidact by necessity and choice, building my own curriculums and learning exactly what I need to build what I envision.

If universities were the only source of knowledge, I'd be doomed. Instead, open-source became my university, my mentors, my pathway to a better life.

## The Power of Collective Achievement

"Together Everyone Achieves More", this isn't just a slogan. It's the foundational truth of open-source. Everyone benefits individually from our collective efforts. We work together, and in doing so, we all achieve more than we ever could alone.

### Linux: The Ultimate Example

Look at Linux, the backbone of the software world. Everyone uses it in one form or another, and anyone who wants something from it can contribute to it. This contribution inherently benefits both the contributor and the entire community.

Thanks to this philosophy, Linux became the most successful non-VC funded project in the world. It's bigger than iOS and Windows by usage and impact, not because of corporate backing, but because people chose to work together. People are bigger than corporate mercenaries.

### Blender: Community Over Competition

Consider Blender, which has created the most tight-knit community in the entire CGI world. Whether everyone admits it or not, everyone within the Blender ecosystem is working together to achieve more. From someone selling assets to a CG artist, from the artist selling results to an end user needing a marketing campaign, that's "Together Everyone Achieves More" in action.

## The Enemy of Progress

Greed is the enemy of true innovation and human progress. I've shown you examples of pure projects that have defeated greedy mercenaries by being their opposite. These projects have had the greatest impact on people's lives, not market cap, not ARR, but real human impact.

Proprietary software is just shorthand for "we are greedy."

## The Choice Before Us

When we work together, we all benefit. Open-source proves this every day, in every line of code shared freely, in every tutorial posted without expectation of payment, in every collaborative project that makes the impossible possible.

This is why "Together Everyone Achieves More" isn't just my philosophy. It's the core of every project I build. Because I know firsthand that when we tear down the walls of artificial scarcity and work together, everyone wins.

The future belongs not to those who hoard knowledge and tools, but to those who share them freely. Together, we achieve more than any corporation ever could alone.
