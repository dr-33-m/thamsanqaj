After we released _Prequel To Artopia_ for my brand, @street\_\_crisis on youtube. The video got engagement we've never had before, it wasnt big but it was something. It wasn't the most high-end 3D video, but it demonstrated the vast potential of CGI as a cost-effective way to create content.

We saw what others were creating with Blender and truly believed in the value of this form of content creation. To reach that level of quality, we knew we’d have to go deeper and invest serious time into mastering Blender ourselves. This meant we had to make a choice; continue running our fashion brand or pursue this new mission. We couldn’t do both successfully.

So, we pivoted.

### Our New Mission: Cr8-xyz

Instead of being a fashion brand, our mission became to simplify CGI for others. We committed to becoming experts in Blender, not just for ourselves, but to build a platform that helps other brands. Our goal is to empower those in the same position we were when we first discovered Blender; they will no longer have to hire a CGI artist or become one themselves.

Alongside my day job, I focus on building and growing this platform during nights and weekends. Our mission is to empower other brands with the capabilities of CGI for their content pipelines, making high-quality visual creation accessible and efficient.
