I created this project for software developers who build a lot of ecommerce projects for clients. It’s a headless Ecommerce Management System (EMS) that connects to an ecommerce storefront.

Here’s how it works: you deploy OpenKommerce, add different ecommerce clients to it so they can manage their inventories and other backend operations, then you just build their storefronts to connect to OpenKommerce.

I haven’t touched it in a while, so contributions are more than welcome, or even a full project takeover if you work in ecommerc
