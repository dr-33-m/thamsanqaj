Prequel to Artopia is a virtual fashion show created entirely in Blender for my fashion brand @street\_\_crisis (IG). I wanted to make a fashion show, but I didn’t have the money for a real-life one, so I started looking around for cheaper but still good alternatives. That’s when I came across Unreal Engine and saw how photorealistic 3D/CGI had gotten, and I immediately knew this was it.

But Unreal Engine couldn’t run for more than an hour without crashing because my laptop only had 4GB of VRAM. My cousin told me to try Blender as an alternative, so I did, and it ran smoothly. I started learning Blender with my best friend and co-designer for the brand, and after 3 months of tutorials, trial, and error, we came out with this show titled Prequel to Artopia.
