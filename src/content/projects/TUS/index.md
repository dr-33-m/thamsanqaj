I created The Underground Scene as an extension of the more creative, artistic side of my brain. As someone who enjoys collaborating with other artists and emerging creatives, I noticed a significant problem: today's social media is oversaturated, and the algorithms make it difficult for lesser-known artists with smaller followings or engagement to get discovered. This creates a barrier for both artists and talent scouts trying to find fresh talent. So, I built The Underground Scene to solve that issue. Its discovery mechanism is simple and effective: artists are ranked on a leaderboard, and the more they post links to their work, the higher they rank, leading to more exposure. The platform encourages consistency and fosters a culture of hard work, giving emerging creatives a fairer chance to be seen and appreciated.
