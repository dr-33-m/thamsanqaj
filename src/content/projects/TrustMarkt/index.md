TrustMarkt was born from my personal experience of being scammed on Facebook Marketplace while trying to buy a second-hand Xbox controller. This incident highlighted the lack of accountability in social commerce, where anonymous accounts can easily defraud buyers.

I developed TrustMarkt to create a verification system for peer-to-peer marketplaces. The platform uses facial recognition and neural networks to create a unique "Trust Mark" based on a seller's facial landmarks, while also registering their location via GPS and linking to their social profiles. This verification system allows buyers to confidently identify legitimate sellers before transacting.

**Current Status:**

- Facial recognition implementation completed
- Project paused due to higher priority commitments
- Available for community contribution via the `feature/verify-page` branch

This project represents an important step toward safer online transactions. If you believe in this mission and would like to continue development, I welcome contributions to build out the remaining features and bring TrustMarkt to life.
